💻 PaxWebOS: The Browser-Based "Operating System" Your IT Department Warned You About
Welcome to PaxWebOS — a web page so convincing, you might just try to Ctrl+Alt+Del your Chrome tab.
This isn't an actual operating system... but your browser doesn't need to know that.

It’s packed with tech-themed applications like:

📡 Ping Pong – a totally accurate network diagnostics tool (also a fun little game).

📝 Notepad++ Plus – not affiliated with Notepad++, we just added another plus.

🗄 Task Mangler – watch as fake processes drain your imaginary CPU.

🐙 Git Blame – a productivity app for figuring out who broke the code (spoiler: it’s you).



🚀 Features
Fake Boot Sequence – Because a spinning loader makes everything more legit.
Retro Pixel UI – It’s like Windows 98 had a baby with a modern design system.
Multiple “Applications” – All running in your browser, no download required.
Customizable Wallpapers – Switch from “Corporate Beige” to “RGB Gamer” mode instantly.
Absolutely Zero Security – Just like the good old days.

🛠 Tech Stack
HTML/CSS – Because pixels don’t place themselves.
JavaScript – Makes the windows draggable and your CPU a little warmer.
LocalStorage – Saving your “files” that aren’t real, forever.
A healthy dose of nostalgia – served fresh on page load.

🖼 Screenshots
Coming soon, right after we “borrow” some UI elements from 1998.

💡 Roadmap
 Add a fake “Blue Screen of Death” Easter egg.

 Make the apps talk to each other in confusing ways.

 Implement “System Updates” that do nothing.

 Launch an NFT marketplace inside the OS (because… why not?).

If you like this project, consider buying me a coffee so I can stay awake long enough to add “Dark Mode.”
